glpk (4.28-1) unstable; urgency=low

    This version of the package reverts the changes in 4.27-1 related to
    the dependencies on libiodbc2 and libmysqlclient15.  The GLPK library
    loads these libraries dynamically on demand now, according to their
    presence in the system.

    In order to get connections between the internal MathProg model
    objects and external database tables, please install the libiodbc2
    (for the iODBC table driver) and libmysqlclient15 (for the MySQL table
    driver).
